## Tasks
- [x] Read the discussion in [#209](https://github.com/SenteraLLC/ulabel/issues/209) and understand the requirements.
- [x] Implement the fix requested in [#209](https://github.com/SenteraLLC/ulabel/issues/209).
- [x] Build the fix and ensure the build succeeds by running `npm run build`.
- [x] Receive confirmation that the fix works as expected.
- [x] Configure Jest to suppress verbose stack traces (added --noStackTrace flag)
- [x] Fix class ID test to check ID is not in existing list (implementation-agnostic)
- [x] Increase max workers from 1 to 2 (reduced test time from 200s+ to ~23s)
- [ ] Fix remaining unit test failures (6 failures, 14 passed)
  - Spatial payload tests need DOM mocking
  - ID payload tests need DOM mocking
  - Note: Some error messages contain minified code context - this is expected when testing against dist/ulabel.js
- [x] Refactor e2e tests to use utility functions
  - [x] Create init_utils.js with waitForULabelInit
  - [x] Create annotation_utils.js with getAnnotationCount, getAnnotationByIndex, getAllAnnotations
  - [x] Create mode_utils.js with switchToMode
  - [x] Create subtask_utils.js with getCurrentSubtask, switchToSubtask, getSubtaskCount
  - [x] Update basic-functionality.spec.js to use new utilities
  - [x] All 6 basic functionality tests passing
