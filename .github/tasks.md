  - [x] Add hover tooltips with detailed descriptions (using title attribute)
  - [x] Add collision detection and red highlighting
  - [x] Implement editing for configurable keybinds
  - [x] Test functionality
- [x] Add support for keybind "chords" (ie, "shift+i")
  - [x] Update keybind edit handler to capture modifier keys (shift, ctrl, alt)
  - [x] Create chord string format (e.g., "shift+i", "ctrl+alt+d")
  - [x] Update key comparison logic in listeners to support chords
  - [x] Update display to show chords properly (displays captured chord automatically)
  - [x] Test chord functionality
- [x] Store collapse/expand for applicable toolbox items
  - [x] Keybinds
  - [x] Annotation List
  - [x] Image Filters
- [x] Make all keybinds configurable
- [x] Minor changes to existing keybinds
  - [x] Rename "Change Zoom" keybind to "Reset Zoom"

- [x] Make class keybinds configurable in the keybinds toolbox item
- [x] Store keybinds in local storage

  - [x] Only show the reset to default for keybinds with user settings, not on those already at the default
  - [x] Make sure the class keybinds also are included in the keybind collision checks
  - [x] Fix reset to default to use constructor-provided config values instead of hardcoded Configuration defaults
  - [x] Centralize keybind config property names in Configuration.KEYBIND_CONFIG_KEYS constant
  - [x] Make KEYBIND_CONFIG_KEYS dynamically generated from Configuration class properties
  - [x] Rename create_bbox_on_initial_crop to create_bbox_on_initial_crop_keybind for consistency
- [ ] Replace any console outputs with `log_message`
- [ ] Write e2e tests for the keybind toolbox item
  - [ ] Ability to set keybind to a chord
  - [ ] Ability to reset keybind
  - [ ] Ability to set a class keybind
- [ ] Write a e2e test for each keybind
