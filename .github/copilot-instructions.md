## General Instructions
- Keep it simple.
- Work in small, incremental changes.
- Ensure changes pass linting checks by running `npm run lint` and waiting for it to complete. Read the linting errors and resolve them manually.
- Ensure changes build successfully by running `npm run build`.
- Do not add new dependencies unless given explicit permission.
- Do not modify the `package.json` or `package-lock.json` files unless instructed.


## Task Tracking
- Always start each step by referencing and updating your tasks in `.github/tasks.md`.
- Use checkboxes to track progress.
- Work on one task at a time.
- Do not mark tasks as complete until they are fully done. Ask for confirmation if unsure.
